			<h3>What is this?</h3>
			It's a graphing calculator web app that plots user-defined javascript functions (x, y) => [r, g, b]. It updates a preview image as the code is edited in the browser. Functions can be plotted at user-specified resolutions.
			<h3>Isn't that a security risk?</h3>
			Yes. Entering or pasting untrusted code poses similar risks to running untrusted code in the browser console. If you're just editing code to plot images as intended, there should be no risk. Your browser tab may hang, particularly at high resolutions.
